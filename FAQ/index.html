		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		
		<h2 class="question" id="question1">When will you ship my order?</h2>
			<p>We ship orders same day if your order is received M-F before 1pm ET, or 1pm PT if you&#39;re shipping to: WA, OR, CA, NV, AZ, TX, NM, UT, CO, ID, WY, MT.
			If your order is received on a weekend or nationally recognized holiday, we will ship your order the next business day.
			</p>
		
		<h2 class="question" id="question2">When will I receive my order?</h2>
			<p>Use this handy estimator for UPS Ground orders. Remember if your order is shipping today, you can DEDUCT a day from the transit time!
			For LTL shipments (15+ cases), please <strong><a href="#">contact us</a></strong> with your zip code.
			</p>
		
		<h2 class="question" id="question3">Do you offer discounts?</h2>
			<p>Since we sell at wholesale prices, we do not offer large retail-type discounts. However, we DO have sales, promotions, and coupon codes! <a href="#"><strong>Sign up for our newsletter</strong></a> to receive periodic email offers. (Don&#39;t worry, we hate spam too, so you&#39;ll only receive 12-14 emails from us per year)<br>
			If you&#39;re interested in a large volume quote above the quanities listed on the website, please <strong><a href="#">contact us</a></strong> with the quantities and products you&#39;d like a quote for.</p>
		
		<h2 class="question" id="question4">What if I need expedited shipping?</h2>
			<p>If you need your order before the expected delivery date, please contact us immediately and note whether or not you have a UPS account we can ship on.
			Please note, if you are ordering bubble products, they come in very large boxes. UPS charges based on dimensional weight (size of the box), not physical weight, so expedited options can be extremely expensive.
			</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question5">What size mailer do I need?</h2>
			<p class="answer5">Ordering mailers that are slightly too small is one of the most common mistakes. Don&#39;t let that pesky 3rd dimension fly under the radar!
			In addition to the width and length of your item, you need to consider 2 pertinent and commonly overlooked factors:</p>
			<ol class="answer5">
				<li><em>The height/thickness of your item.</em> Add this number to the dimension that is closest to the mailer dimension. Example: xx</li>
				<li><em>Manufacturing variances.</em> Just like a snowflake, no two mailers are exactly the same. (Well, maybe that&#39;s a bad comparison, but the point is materials can shrink and stretch when heat is applied in the manufacturing process.) Since there is no way to guarantee exact dimensions throughout an entire manufacturing production run, you should account for an extra 0.25&#34; on each side of item just in case you end up with a mailer on the smaller side.

		<h2 class="question" id="question6">How can I track my order?</h2>
			<p>We highly recommend creating an account so you can track all your orders through our site, as well as have a record of your order history in case you lose the emails.
			Whether or not you create an accounts, you&#39;ll receive a shipping notification via email with the tracking info after your order ships.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question6">What if I need a quantity that is less than a case?</h2>
			<p>We only sell in full cases, but we&#39;d love to refer you to a supplier that can fulfill your needs. Please <strong><a href="#">contact us</a></strong> with the quantity and product you&#39;re looking for.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question7">Do you have a location I can pick up at?</h2>
			<p>We&#39;re an ecommerce company without brick and mortar locations. If you prefer to pick up your order from our warehouse in Phoenix, AZ or Middletown, OH, please <strong><a href="#">contact us</a></strong> and leave a phone # where you can be reached.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question8">Do you offer samples before I purchase?</h2>
			<p>Yes, we offer free samples of our products. Most can be shipped to you free of charge. Click on the Request a sample tab on the product page of the item you&#39;re interested in. If a shipping charge applies, we will email you. 
			We ship samples via USPS First Class mail unless expedited shipping is needed. For expedited shipping of a sample, please <strong><a href="#">contact us</a></strong> immediately for options.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question9">Can I place an order over the phone?</h2>
			<p>In order to remain price-competitive, we&#39;ve not been staffed to handle phone orders. All orders can be placed through our website. However, if you&#39;re having trouble checking out or have questions, we do have real humans that would be happy to assist. <strong><a href="#">Contact us</a></strong>  and leave a phone # for a call back. We&#39;ll return your call same business day if received by 2pm PT.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question10">Do you have a catalog?</h2>
			<p>Since we&#39;re solely an ecommerce company, our most up-to-date, and best place to find products is our website.</p>

		<h2 class="question" id="question11">
		What is your return policy?</h2>
			<p>We offer free samples of most of our products to ensure you are satisfied before ordering. (shipping charge applies to select requests)
